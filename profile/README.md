# Welcome to LincsLabInterns!

This organization serves as a collaborative platform for interns at the Lincs Lab to manage and organize their project codes effectively. It is an integral part of our effort to streamline research workflows, promote teamwork, and ensure accessibility to project resources.

# About Lincs Lab

The laboratory aims at carrying out research on issues related to communication networks. The contexts of user mobility, velocity and variety of data, and diversity of user applications often pose complex problems of general coordination, resource management, low-latency and real-time service delivery, and reliability.  

In order to address these problems, the activities of the laboratory exploit and integrate various techniques and methodologies, including:
- **Mathematical modeling**  
- **Machine learning techniques**
- **Quantum Computing and Quantum Machine Learning**
- **Signal processing**  
- **Systems simulation**  
- **Prototyping and experimentation**  

The activities of our lab are particularly interested in the following areas:  
- **Next-generation networks (5G and beyond)**  
- **Edge computing**  
- **Network intelligence**  
- **Communication networks for verticals** such as Connected and Autonomous Cars, IoT, and Industrial IoT
